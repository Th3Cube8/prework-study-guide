# Cam's Study Guide, AKA first web application built!

## Description

I made this application as a starting point for my process of learning coding. I had no previous experience on any coding language before making this study guide and it will be used as a way to help me remember everything i learned while making it. Im not sure exactly what I think was the most important thing I learned during this process was but I can tell you that everything learned played a specific roll and has a job to do. Started by learning a developers mindset of never growing complacent and always trying to grow and learn more. Falling into a negative mindset has been a huge downfall to me in the past and spending the time to read about the growth mindset allowed me to keep my eyes down the road and continue to work when I felt irritated and lost. I then learned how to set up SSH keys which was where I encountered my first real problem of not properly connecting to github.com host and not properly moving an unzipped file. I then learned how to use GitHub and Git and many of the terms and how to use both like; how to navigate repos, how to add branches, how to push and pull branches, how to manage pull requests and more. When first working with Git and all the terms I was very very confused, a lot of it felt like nonsense and repeating of words i already knew with completely different meanings. This all started to make more sense as I had to commit branches and use the commands and terms more and more. Then moved on to working with my first language which was HTML. We were given a baseline of some of the HTML document which included some of the header and the entire footer and the body left blank for us to start to add the first HTML commands we learned like the list commands 'ul', 'ol', and 'li'; adding sections and how to classify them into cards and giving each their own id. I then learned how to use CSS to style the webpage. On my webpage I used it to disply the image in a certain spot, give the header and footer a colored box to sit in at opposite ends of the webpage, and to give each box its own outline and shadow. This was all done on its own seperate file which we then linked to the HTML doc by using a link command in the head element. Then I added some JavaScript code which really can only be seen by inspecting the page and looking at the console. This was also done in its own file which we linked to the HTML doc by adding a script src at the very end of the body element. Accessing the console will show us the topics learned while creating the study guide, it will also randomy select one to study everytime we open or refresh the page. Having this list of and having that randomly generated topic to study was done by adding functions, for loops, and console logs. The main struggles i went through while doing this was problems with branches merging and my branches not being pulled into the correct places. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This webpage will be used to study and go over everything I learned while creating it. Going over lots the terms for each type of language and the commands to using git. Each section contains its own notes for the topic at the beginning of the box. Opening the DevTools console will allow us to see the JavaScript running and will allow us to see all the topics we learned listed as well as picking a random topic for us to study.
