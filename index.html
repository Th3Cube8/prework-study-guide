        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML: Hypertext Markup Language</li>
          <li>Elements: Types of content on web page. Examples are, Text elements, Image elements, Header elements, and List elements</li>
          <li>Head Element contains information or metadata about webpage. Helps browser render page, is not visible when user looks at page</li>
          <li>Body Element contains content that is shown to user, elements we want user to interact with go here</li>
          <li>Title: defines the title of the webpage, is required and is important for the SEO</li>
          <li>SEO or Search Engine Optimization is the process of improving the ranking of a website in  the search engines</li>
          <li>Style: defines CSS styles associated with site</li>
          <li>Base: defines the base URL for a webpage</li>
          <li>Link: connects an external resource to an HTML Document</li>
          <li>Meta: defines meatadata such as character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport</li>
          <li>Script: embeds client-side scripts in HTML document</li>
          <li>Charset: element that sets our character encoding</li>
          <li>http-equiv: sets an HTTP header for content</li>
          <li>Viewport: sets the default view for a webpage</li>
          <li>Child Elements are elements nested inside other elements, Parent elements are the ones they are nested inside</li>
          <li>In Seantic HTML Elements the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on the web page</li>
          <li>div: creates a division in the page</li>
          <li>span: creates inline division</li>
          <li>On visible HTML elements all content is between an opening and closing tag</li>
          <li>Element and Tag are commonly used interchangably, there are differences though</li>
          <li>Element- entire element from opening tag to closing tag</li>
          <li>Tag- refers to only what is inside angle brackets</li>
          <li>p: Represents a paragraph or block of text</li>
          <li>ul: unordered list</li>
          <li>ol: ordered list</li>
          <li>li: list item</li>
          <li>img: contains info about images displayed</li>
          <li>src= attribute most important because it deffines the location of image</li>
          <li>br: creates a line of empty space, or line break, between two blocks of content</li>
          <li>a (stands for anchor): creates link to the same webpage or other webpages</li>
          <li>href: attribute points to the URL for the link</li>
          <li>id: attribute is a way of identifying elements and selecting them</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Selector defines the element or attribute to which the rules/declaration will aply</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two conponents, the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
          <li>Margin property acts like a margin in a word processing document, it indicates how much space we want on the OUTSIDE of an element, not visible just acts like a buffer</li>
          <li>Padding property adds space around the content INSIDE an element, increase in padding makes entire element bigger</li>
          <li>To apply a rule to all elements on a page use special wild card symbol or *</li>
          <li>Combining two selectors into a single CSS rule is done using a comma, helps not write "Do Not Repeat Yourself" (Dry) Code</li>
          <li>DRY is a principle that encourages devs to share or reuse code in order to reduce lines of code</li>
          <li>rel attribute specifies relationship between current document and the linked document resource</li>
          <li>href attribute specifiesthe location (URL) of external resource</li>
          <li>Class attribute allows us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector</li>
          <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done by semantic references, hexadecimal code, or hex #</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Merge: after a pull request is approved, the commit will be pulled in (or merged) from one branch to another and then, deployed on the live site</li>
          <li>Issues: allow users to report issues or bugs and track progress of assigning the fix for the issues</li>
          <li>Federalist: a platform that securely deploys a website from a GitHub repository in minutes and lets users preview proposed and published changes</li>
          <li>Projects: allows you to use GitHub for project management and tracking a set of issues, either for a specific repo or an entire org</li>
          <li>Wiki — a section of a repo made for hosting documentation. Documentation may be in the repo’s README files instead</li>
